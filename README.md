## Project Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.27.1 â€¢ channel stable
- Dart 3.6.0
- Xcode (updated version recommended)

### Installation Steps and Running the Project

1- Install flutter and add it in your path.

2- Execute `flutter clean`,` flutter pub get`.

3- Execute `dart pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

4- Execute `flutter run --dart-define=API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}`

### Application Structure and Features

This project follows the [Clean Architecture]("https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html") principles, separating the code into different layers:

Presentation: Contains Flutter widgets and state management (using Bloc).

Domain: Contains business logic and entities.

Data: Handles data retrieval and storage, including API calls and local storage.

#### Key Features

Fetching weather condition and forecast for the give city name.

Handle errors and failures.

selection of the forecast.

#### Bonuses

Handling nested Vertical and Horizontal Scrollable layouts.

Changing the temperature unit will update the result.

### Testing

#### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, execute:

```sh
flutter test
```

#### Running Unit Tests with coverage

To the tests with coverage, execute:

```sh
flutter test --coverage
```

This command runs the tests and generates a coverage report in the coverage directory.

#### View Coverage Report

The coverage report is generated in a lcov.info file located inside the coverage directory. To view this report in a more readable format, you can use an HTML report generator like lcov.

```sh
brew install lcov
```

Run the following commands to generate and view the HTML report:

```sh
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

This command converts the lcov.info file into an HTML report and places it in the coverage/html directory.

Open the HTML report in your browser:

```sh
open coverage/html/index.html
```
